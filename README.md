Project Overview
This project analyzes aviation incidents and accidents using Statistics Canadaâ€™s Air Transportation dataset. By leveraging Power BI, we visualize key trends in incident frequency, severity, geographic distribution, and causes of injuries to enhance aviation safety insights.

Data Preparation
I conducted the initial data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency before visualization. This involved:
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns.
- Handling missing values and standardizing date formats.
- Transforming categorical data for better analysis in Power BI.

 Key Insights
- Trends Over Time: Aviation incidents peaked in the 1980s and early 2000s but declined after 2020 due to COVID-19.
- Seasonal Patterns: Most incidents occur in July, likely due to increased flight traffic.
- Incident Types: The most common are "Unknown (41.62%)", "Emergency/Priority (19.63%)", and "Engine Issues (10.57%)".
- Geographic Hotspots: Clusters of high-severity incidents in China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Russia, possibly linked to harsh climate and low population density.
- Injury Trends: Fatal injuries spiked in 2000, but safety measures have reduced their occurrence in recent years.
